## 2) Config

### Auth Provider Config

Configuration is done with environment variables, which can be supplied as command line arguments, added in your app hosting interface, or loaded from a .env file.

**Example .env file:**

```
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=f432a9casdff1e4b79c57
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=pampadympapampadympapampadympa
REDIRECT_URL=https://your.server.com/callback
GIT_HOSTNAME=https://github.website.com
SSL_ENABLED=1
```

**Client ID & Client Secret:**
After registering your Oauth app, you will be able to get your client id and client secret on the next page.

**Redirect URL (optional):**
Include this if you  need your callback to be different from what is supplied in your Oauth app configuration.

**Git Hostname (Optional):**
This is only necessary for use with Github Enterprise.

### CMS Config
You also need to add `base_url` to the backend section of your netlify-cms's config file. `base_url` is the live URL of this repo with no trailing slashes.

```
backend:
  name: github
  repo: user/repo   # Path to your Github repository
  branch: master    # Branch to update
  base_url: https://your.server.com # Path to ext auth provider
```

## 3) Run it
With your virtual environment activated run the server as follows

`python main.py`
